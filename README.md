# Testing-Node-API
API Testing in Node.js involves checking whether an API works as expected by sending 
requests and receiving responses from endpoints. It ensures that the API adheres to the 
expected behavior in terms of functionality, performance, security, and data handling. 
 
Key Concepts: 
1.API: An Application Programming Interface (API) allows different software systems to 
communicate with each other, typically using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, 
DELETE, etc. 
  2. Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run server-side  
                        code written in JavaScript. 
                        3. API Testing: Involves testing APIs directly to check: 
      4. Correctness: Are the expected data and responses returned? 
      5. Performance: Is the API responsive and performant? 
      Security: Is the API secure and properly authenticated?
